    <h2>Bio/Summary</h2>
    <p> Creative, Problem-Solver. After earning my Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering and working in a Quality Engineering role for a year, I have decided to take my current skills and improve on them to take my career in a new direction. I am enrolled in a Full Stack coding bootcamp at Grand Circus, gaining experience in C# and .NET Framework. I would like to use my skills and experience to build a rewarding career in programming working with people to make a difference in my community. </p>
